# LDA models benchmark
We showed the result of different combination of data preprocessing steps here: <a href="https://tum-idp-ws-20.github.io/doc/milestone-1-datapreprocessing-steps-comparison-based-on-LDA">Data preprocessing steps comparison based on LDA Recommendation</a>. We extend our LDA model with different configuration e.g. # of topic, # of words in each topic. In this document, we will talk about the result we got.

We tested many models but we will put here most promising 6 models in addition to previous models. The setting is the same with the previous one, we trained the model for the first 3 pages of the documents and the 10 pages of the documents. For each model, you can see the actual coding process in the notebook by clicking the model name.
